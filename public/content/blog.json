Workout Explanations (What to do + Why)
Sunday — OFF (Full Recovery)
No running today. Hydrate, sleep, and take an easy walk if it helps you feel better. This is when your body absorbs the work from the week and gets stronger.
Monday — Easy + Power Strides
Run 4–6 miles easy. Include 6 × 30 seconds uphill strides run fast but controlled with 1–2 minutes recovery. Perform halfway through your run or when you find a good hill. Purpose: build neuromuscular power with minimal fatigue.
Tuesday — Strength / Mobility (Moderate)
Focus on hips, posterior chain, core, and upper back. Keep it challenging but not exhausting. Purpose: improve posture, durability, and power transfer.
Wednesday — Hill Strength Session (Key Intensity Day)
Warm up with 3 miles easy. Then complete 6 × 2 minutes uphill at roughly 5K effort with downhill jog recovery. Follow with 4 × 1 minute hard uphill efforts at mile intensity. Purpose: develop aerobic power and hill-specific strength.
Thursday — Strength / Mobility (Lighter)
Keep this session lighter than Tuesday. Emphasize mobility, stability, and movement quality. Purpose: maintain durability while staying fresh.
Friday — True Recovery Run
Run 5–8 miles super easy. If you think you're running slow, slow down more. Conversational effort only. Purpose: aerobic development and preparation for the long run.
Saturday — Long Run with Quality (Durability Builder)
Run 8–14 miles in Zone 2. During the run include 20 minutes at 1–2 minutes faster than
